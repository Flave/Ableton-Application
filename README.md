Hey there,

my name is Flavio. When I saw your job posting I instantly knew that I had to apply for this position. It doesn’t happen every day that so many of one’s interests get mentioned in one single job description.

I just recently graduated from FH Potsdam in Interface Design. Luckily I was able to work for a variety of different companies before and during my studies. Although I studied design, a considerable amount of my time goes into coding (whether this is for money or for fun). At some point in my studies I realised the power that lies in the ability to build my own designs and design my own builds (crappy pun intended winking face). I was lucky enough to get an internship in front-end development in London where I had plenty of time diving into the subject. Shortly after that I started a part job in Berlin developing web based prototypes and data visualisations. While my expertise certainly lies in coding for visual output (as opposed to acoustic), I was able to gain some experience in Audio Programming in smaller projects.

Having spent most of my adolescent life behind my drums, playing in rock and funk bands and percussion ensembles, I can say that I’m definitely not new to the field of music. After I abandoned my plans to study Jazz I became more interested in creating music the digital way. Despite a number of attempts, I never really followed through again with starting a new musical project (i.e. band). Nevertheless I was able to gain experience with digital music on project such as this one (https://vimeo.com/63228955).

During my studies as well as my internship at Frog I got more and more interested in the field of education. I am mostly interested in the role of the computer in modern education and the possibilities that come with it. I got in touch with the teachings of Seymour Papert and his way of making the computer a central part of learning. Naturally I also became a big fan of the community around Explorable Explanations which I’m quite sure you are aware of. As part of that new interest I also got interested in the educational part of journalism. To some extent the job of a journalist (or news media in general) is to convey complex topics in such a way that they are graspable for people who only spend a limited amount of time on it. 

Having a background in interface/interaction design I’m very aware of the ways people perceive information and interact with technology. I am very much interested in combining that knowledge with my experience in working with code in order to convey complex topics (or not complex for that matter) in a graspable fashion.

I made a little compilation of some of my projects that you might be interested in. Feel free to browse and play around with it at http://flavio.is/applying/at/ableton.

I’m very much looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,
Flavio
